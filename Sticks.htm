		<h3>Sticks</h3>	
		<h4>Mens Lacrosse Sticks</h4>
		<p>Mens lacrosse sticks have three different types of sticks. Their are short sticks, long sticks, and goalie sticks. A stick has two parts which are a head and a shaft. The head is a plastic oval with a mesh pocket used to carry the lacrosse ball. The shaft is a metal rod typically made of titanium or alloy. Short sticks are used by offensive players. The length of the short stick is between 40 and 42 inches including the head of the stick. A long stick is between 52 and 72 inches including the head. The goalie stick has a large head and shaft for goalies. The goalie head is more of a circle compared to other sticks and has a much deeper mesh pocket. The stick is between 40 and 72 inches.</p>
		<h4>Womens Lacrosse Sticks</h4>
		<p>Womens lacrosse has two different types of sticks. Womens lacrosse has short sticks and goalie sticks. The main difference between a mens stick and women's stick is a women's stick does not have a deep pocket compared to a men's stick. Therefore carrying the ball is more difficult making the women's game a more finesse game. A women's lacrosse stick can be 35 to 42 inches depending on the level of play. The goalie stick in women's lacrosse is exactly the same as mens lacrosse.</p>
